			"S_thumb_format": "svg",
			"S_Screen": "<div class=\"hero\"> <img src=\"images/hero-sourcesetr-lg.svg\" alt=\"Sourcesetr logo\"> </div> <div class=\"container\"> <p> <b>I hate wasting time</b>. Recently I spent some time showing off HTML5&rsquo;s <code>picture</code> element to a new client. I also wrote some new presentation notes for one of <a href=\"http://drexel.edu/westphal/academics/undergraduate/wbdv/\" target=\"_blank\" >Drexel&rsquo;s web authoring</a> classes focused on the concept of responsive images. As I was working through examples, I was frustrated by the amount of time it was taking to build the various image files I needed. I was even more surprised by how most of the design software I am using does not include quick way to export a single image to an array of sizes/resolutions. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://sketchapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch</a> has some flexibility, allowing you to setup multiple exports of an artboard or element group at various sizes or image formats. It works if I&rsquo;m working in Sketch, although it takes more time to setup the export rules than I like to spend. </p> <p> For non vector images, I end up in Adobe Photoshop more often than not. Adobe has built in some tools for exporting layers to files, with slick naming conventions to save a layer to multiple file formats/sizes. To me, it&rsquo;s clunky at best. It works but the setup takes to long, and I&rsquo;ve never been able to memorize the naming convention to a point that it becomes second nature. By the time I look it up, I&rsquo;ve already wasted to much time. </p> <p> I decided to built a utility to hopefully speed up my workflow in the case where I have a single image that I need made available at multiple sizes for the web. Enter <b>Sourcesetr</b>. </p> <p> Let&rsquo;s say I have three images. I want to have a copy of each graphic optimized for a minimum screen width of <i>56.25em (~900px)</i> and at <i>18.75em (~300px)</i>. I also want <i>2x</i> versions for retina support. So four total exports, for each of my three images. Twelve total image files. </p> <p> Rather than go through the export process multiple times in Photoshop, I export one copy of each image at a high res. For this example I think I used <i>2000px</i> wide for each. </p> <p> Once I have my source file for each of the three images, I configure Sourcesetr to export image files for me @900px and @300px wide. The script takes each source file, does the scaling for <i>1x</i> and <i>2x</i> versions of each image at each size I've requested. In less than three seconds I have all twelve of the images I need to build my responsive <code>picture</code> element on my webpage. The script also generates some sample code to help with implementation. </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint hidden-small\">&lt;picture&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 900px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-001-900.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-001-900@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 300px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-001-300.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-001-300@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;img src=&quot;sourcesetr-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#10;&lt;/picture&gt; &#10;&lt;picture&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 900px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-002-900.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-002-900@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 300px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-002-300.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-002-300@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;img src=&quot;sourcesetr-002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#10;&lt;/picture&gt; &#10;&lt;picture&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 900px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-003-900.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-003-900@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 300px)&quot; srcset=&quot;sourcesetr-003-300.jpg 1x, sourcesetr-003-300@2x.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;img src=&quot;sourcesetr-003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#10;&lt;/picture&gt;</pre> <p> After adding my responsive images to my page and testing, I quickly realize that I need another copy of the image files at <i>~600px</i>. Quick fix - I can update the config file of Sourcesetr to crank out another batch of image files at the size I need and quickly add them to my project. No fumbling with Photoshop layer names. No shoehorning another export into Sketch&rsquo;s list of files. The goal here is <b>simple and fast</b>. </p> <p> Is it perfect? Of course not. This doesn&rsquo;t work in cases where you need art direction for the various versions. But in those cases you&rsquo;re probably setting up multiple artboards anyway so you&rsquo;re managing each set of exports separately. This tools is for cases where the image ratio and content is going to stay the same for all versions. </p> <p> Sourcesetr works with <i>.jpg</i> and <i>.png</i> files, and will crank out <i>1x</i> and <i>2x</i> versions of each file. Other formats and sizes could easily be added as needed. </p> <p> The script and full documentation is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/philsinatra/Sourcesetr\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> and the script has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sourcesetr\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> account for quick support. </p> </div>"
